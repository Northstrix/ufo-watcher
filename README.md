# Ufo Watcher
A Wii-like game that can be controlled using either a Nintendo Wii Nunchuk or a phone.

The game itself, along with the firmware for the ESP8266 that handles the Nintendo Wii Nunchuk, was made using Gemini 3. The Python script that makes the game treat the phone’s accelerometer as a Nunchuk stick was created by Perplexity.
